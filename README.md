# Instagram reach analysis 
# Objective: 
The goal of this project was to develop a Machine Learning model to analyze and predict the reach of Instagram posts based on engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, etc.).

# Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: 
I began by collecting data, which included various engagement metrics for Instagram posts. Preprocessing involved cleaning the data to remove any noise, inconsistencies, or missing values, ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.

# Feature Engineering: 
This step involved transforming raw data into meaningful features that could help our model make accurate predictions. For example,  might have created new features such as the ratio of likes to comments or the time of day the post was made.

# Applying Regression Models: 
I used regression models, which are types of supervised learning algorithms, to predict the number of impressions (reach) an Instagram post would get. By training our model on historical data, it learned to predict future outcomes based on the given input features.

# Deployment with Streamlit: 
To make our model accessible and user-friendly, i deployed it using Streamlit. Streamlit is a framework that allows you to create interactive web applications quickly. In our case, it enabled users to input their engagement metrics and visualize the predicted reach of their Instagram posts through an interactive dashboard.

# Technologies Used:

## Python: The primary programming language for building the model.

## Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Scikit-learn: A library for machine learning that provided the regression algorithms.

## Matplotlib: A plotting library for visualizing data.

## Streamlit: A tool for deploying machine learning models as web applications.
